## Getting started
To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

##### $ bundle install --without production

Next, migrate the database:

##### $ rails db:migrate

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

##### $ rails test

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

##### $ rails server
